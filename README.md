# Indian Bank IFSC Codes

Based on [MySQL dump](https://github.com/bhavyanshu/indian-bank-ifsc-branch-database-sql) which, in turn, is based on the unwieldy [excel file from RBI](http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/docs/68774.xls). I doubt if I'll be updating this very often, but am happy to accept pull requests. Things that could come in are MICR codes, SWIFT codes.

Dump of PostgreSQL tables with IFSC codes of bank branches.

The SQL dump has two table and one view.
* **banks** - has two columns id and name (e.g. ICICI). The id was generated by me and is not universal.
* **branches** - has details of all branches. IFSC code is the primary key of this table. Has bank_id which is a foreign key reference into banks table.
* **bank_branches** - view on top of these tables that joins on bank_id. Convenient if you want to search by bank name
